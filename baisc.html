        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>Art is one of the best things that exist. Most of my favorite hobbies relate to Art.</p>

        <h2>Lists of Art hobbies</h2>

        <p>When I have free time I like to:</p>

        <p>If I had to rate these art hobbies, I would rate them like this:</p>

        <ol>

            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Using watercolors</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Art?</h2>

        <p><em>Art</em>, serves as a way to express yourself and let your creativity show.</p>

        <p>Art doesn't neccessarily have to be drawing or painting. It can also be <strong>music</strong> from different time periods.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Beethoven's pieces are ART!</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>I am glad Art in general exists and that many paintors, film makers, musicians, and other artists got to show their skills.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

        <p>Regards,<br/>
